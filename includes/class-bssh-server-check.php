/**
 * Ask the site, over HTTP, which of these headers it is actually sending, and
 * which of them come from the server rather than from PHP.
 *
 * The problem this solves: once the plugin is active you cannot tell, by
 * looking at a response, whether a header came from Kinsta, from xCloud, from
 * the theme, from another plugin, or from here. PHP's header() replaces
 * silently, so the plugin can be overriding the host's own configuration and
 * nothing anywhere says so.
 *
 * The trick is the first probe. It fetches a static file — this plugin's own
 * stylesheet — which nginx serves straight off disk without ever starting PHP.
 * Any header on that response is the server's, because there was nothing else
 * to produce it. The second probe fetches the home page, which is what a
 * visitor actually receives. Comparing the two separates "the host does this"
 * from "we do this".
 *
 * That difference is also the plugin's main limitation made visible: a header
 * set from PHP reaches HTML pages and nothing else. Scripts, stylesheets and
 * images are served by the web server directly, so the static probe is also an
 * honest picture of what your CSS and JS responses carry.
