# Security Headers

Sends the response security headers that managed WordPress hosts and WordPress
itself leave off.

Built and maintained by [Biscuit Studios](https://biscuitstudios.com/) for our
own client sites. Published because it may be useful to others, not because it
is a supported product. See [Support](#support).

## What switches on by itself

Activating the plugin is the whole setup. Three headers start sending
immediately, and none of them can break a normal site:

| Header | Value | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Stops the full address of the page a visitor was on travelling with them to other sites. Sends the domain name only. |
| `Permissions-Policy` | camera, microphone and the three motion sensors blocked | Refuses those features outright, so nothing that reaches a page can prompt a visitor for them. |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `SAMEORIGIN` | Stops another site displaying these pages in a frame, which is how clickjacking works. |

Three more are available and start switched off, because each one can break
something or is already handled elsewhere:

| Header | Why it is off |
|---|---|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | Cannot be undone. See below. |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Has to be written against what a particular site actually loads. |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | Kinsta and xCloud already send it. Here for portability. |

## What it deliberately does not do

**No `.htaccess` or `wp-config.php` edits.** Nothing is written to disk. The
plugin sets headers from PHP and that is all, so deactivating it removes every
trace of it from a response immediately, and there is no file left behind on a
server it was never meant to touch.

**No `X-XSS-Protection` and no `Expect-CT`.** Both are dead. `X-XSS-Protection`
was removed from Chrome and Edge, and the filter it switched on was itself an
attack vector; the correct modern value is `0`, which is the same as not sending
it. `Expect-CT` was deprecated in 2021 and removed. Plugins still offering these
are offering a green tick, not a defence. The check screen reports them if
something else on the site is sending them, so you can go and turn that off.

**No HSTS `includeSubDomains`, and no `preload`.** Not as a default, as a
capability. There is no setting for either and the code cannot assemble the
tokens. `includeSubDomains` takes down any subdomain still served over plain
HTTP; `preload` puts the domain on a list compiled into the browsers themselves,
which takes months and a browser release to leave. Neither belongs behind a
checkbox on a site you manage for somebody else.

**Nothing in wp-admin that WordPress already does.** Core sends
`X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and a `frame-ancestors` policy on admin and
login screens. The plugin stays out of the way for those three and sends only
what core leaves out. In particular it never sends your site's CSP inside
wp-admin, because PHP replaces headers rather than merging them, and doing so
would quietly delete core's protection against the dashboard being framed.

## HSTS, and why it starts at five minutes

HSTS is a note the site hands a visitor's browser saying "only ever talk to me
over the secure connection, and remember that". The browser obeys for as long as
the note says, and **nothing can reach back and tell it to forget sooner.** If
the certificate later breaks, those visitors get a hard wall with no way past.

Your host's "Force HTTPS" setting is a different thing. That is a redirect, run
on the server, for everybody, every time. HSTS sits on top of it and closes the
one gap a redirect cannot: the very first request, which still leaves the
visitor's device before the redirect comes back.

So the duration dropdown starts at five minutes. Switch it on, check the site,
come back and lengthen it. Only a duration you have already lived with is safe
to keep.

## Seeing what is actually being sent

Once several things can set a header, you cannot tell from a response which one
did. The **Check what this site sends** button fetches two URLs and shows them
side by side:

- **A stylesheet**, which the web server hands over without ever starting
  WordPress. Anything on that response came from your host.
- **The home page**, which is what a visitor receives.

Anything in the first column is your host's, and applies to every file it
serves. Anything that appears only in the second column is set by WordPress:
this plugin, the theme, or another plugin. Where the two differ, WordPress is
replacing your host's value.

That difference is also the plugin's main limit, made visible. **A header set
from PHP reaches HTML pages and nothing else.** Your scripts, stylesheets and
images are served by the web server directly and carry only what the server
puts on them. Where you can configure headers at the server, that is strictly
better. This plugin is the portable version that behaves the same everywhere.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.3 or later
- PHP 8.2 or later

## Installation

Download the zip from
[Releases](https://github.com/biscuitstudios/bs-security-headers/releases), then
**Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**. Settings live under **Settings → Security
Headers**.

## Uninstalling

Deactivating stops every header immediately, because the hooks stop firing.
Deleting the plugin removes its settings. Nothing was written to a file, so
there is nothing else to clean up.

## Support

None, in the usual sense. This is published as-is, and we make changes when our
own client work calls for them.

You are welcome to fork it. If you find a genuine security problem, please
report it privately using the **Security** tab on this repository rather than
opening it in public.
